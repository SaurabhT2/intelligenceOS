/**
 * @platform/cognition-contract — CognitionProvider.ts
 *
 * The complete behavioral surface between BrandOS and IntelligenceOS.
 * Exactly five operations. Per PLATFORM_CONTRACT.md §3:
 * if a new need doesn't fit one of these five, the answer is a richer
 * CognitionContext (see CognitionContext.ts), not a sixth method.
 *
 * BrandOS's `@brandos/cognition-client` package is the ONLY BrandOS package
 * that may hold a concrete CognitionProvider. IntelligenceOS's `api/`
 * module is the only place that may implement it. No other package in
 * either repository may depend on this interface directly.
 *
 * See this package's README, "Known contract gaps", for two product
 * surfaces (raw-signal review UI, explicit persona/brand-voice
 * configuration ingestion) that do not yet have a home in this interface
 * and require an explicit decision before they can be fully migrated.
