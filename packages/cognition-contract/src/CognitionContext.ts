/**
 * @platform/cognition-contract — CognitionContext.ts
 *
 * THE canonical, cross-repository system contract between BrandOS
 * (Execution Platform) and IntelligenceOS (Cognitive Platform).
 *
 * Governed by, and must be kept consistent with:
 *   - docs/PLATFORM_CONTRACT.md
 *   - docs/PLATFORM_CONTRACT.md
 *   - docs/PLATFORM_CONTRACT.md §4
 *
 * THIS FILE IS THE ENTIRE COGNITIVE VOCABULARY BRANDOS IS PERMITTED TO HAVE.
 * If a concept does not appear here, BrandOS cannot use it — not because of
 * a missing import, but because it does not exist from BrandOS's point of
 * view (PLATFORM_CONTRACT.md §4).
 *
 * Every field is a finished cognitive OUTCOME — a judgment IntelligenceOS
 * has already reached. None of it is an INGREDIENT a consumer could
 * recombine into a new conclusion. Before adding a field, check it against
 * PLATFORM_CONTRACT.md §4 "What is permanently excluded": no raw or
 * unconsolidated signals, no repository/storage references, no extractor or
 * resolver identifiers, no internal confidence calculations, no workspace
 * history beyond what Provenance summarizes.
 *
 * DUPLICATION NOTICE: until both repositories can depend on a single
 * published `@platform/cognition-contract` package from a shared registry,
 * this file is physically duplicated — byte-for-byte — in both the
 * `brandos` and `intelligence-os` repositories, at
 * `packages/cognition-contract/src/CognitionContext.ts`. See this
 * package's README for the tracked follow-up to collapse the duplication.
 * Until that follow-up lands, any change to this file must be applied to
 * both copies in the same change set — this is the one exception the
 * "no duplicated intelligence logic" rule tolerates, because it duplicates
 * a type-only contract, not a capability.
